name: Python Import All Test
author: Christian Brenninkmeier, Donal Fellows
description: >
  Runs a simple test to import all the Python files beneath a particular module.
  Useful for smoke-testing whether there are import loops;
  a common failing of Python IDEs is that they're poor at finding import loops.

  Assumes that Python has already been set up.
