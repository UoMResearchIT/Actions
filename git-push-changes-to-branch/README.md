# Push Changes to Git Branch

Detects if there are changes; if there are, commits them to a new branch.
The actual creation of the changes to start out with is beyond the scope of this action.
It's intended to be used by the `license-copyright-add` workflow in repositories derived from the standard RSE templates.

Example:
```yml
      - name: Detect and push changes
        uses: UoMResearchIT/actions/git-push-changes-to-branch@main
        id: push
        with:
          working-directory: repo
          branch-prefix: add-license-headers-to
          commit-message: Add License and Copyright Headers
      - name: Commit comment if had to create new branch
        if: steps.push.outputs.changed == 1
        uses: peter-evans/commit-comment@v3
        with:
          body: >
            Copyright updates at
            ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/compare/${{ github.head_ref }}...${{ steps.push.outputs.branch }}?expand=1,
            please review and merge.
```
