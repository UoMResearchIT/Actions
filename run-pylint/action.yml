  Runs pylint on a Python package. 
inputs:
  package:
    description: The name of the Python package (or packages) to analyse.
    required: true
  disable:
    description: The messages/categories to disable.
    required: false
    default: "R"
  jobs:
    description: The number of Python processes to use.
    required: false
    default: "1"
  rcfile:
    description: >
      The name of the pylint rc file.
      "global_relaxed" and "global_strict" will use configurations built into this action.
      Any other value is a file in the job workspace.
    required: false
    default: global_relaxed
  exitcheck:
    description: >
      The combined results code to fail on.
      The default makes anything of severity WARNING and above into a failure; this is normally
      sufficient.
    required: false
    default: "6"  # Action fails on ERROR or WARNING
    # Pylint should leave with following status code:
    #    0 if everything went fine
    #    1 if a fatal message was issued
    #    2 if an error message was issued
    #    4 if a warning message was issued
    #    8 if a refactor message was issued
    #   16 if a convention message was issued
    #   32 on usage error
    # to die on fatal, error or usage the recommended way is
    #   exit $(($? & 35))
    # We handle that internally.
    #
    # Also note that we ALWAYS die on Fatal or Usage problems; others are
    # selectable.
