# Our Code of Conduct

We will:

* Behave professionally.
* Treat each other with respect.
* Review the contribution, not the contributor, with one exact exception: whether the contributor is a member of the University of Manchester.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We will not normally accept contributions of actions from outside the University of Manchester (and its alumni, at our discretion) or where we cannot determine if the contribution is from the inside or outside of the University.
> External parties can freely publish their own actions without any assistance from us.

We will attempt to:

* Resolve matters in a timely fashion.
* Keep contributors informed of decisions (or reasons for delaying a decision) in regards to their contribution. 

> [!NOTE]
> The first three points are the code that we follow, and the other points extend that to the code that we aspire to follow.  Arguably, those are points that are part of _behaving professionally_ and _treating with respect_ but it helps to have them as explicit goals.
