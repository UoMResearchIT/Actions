# Our Code of Conduct

We will:

* Follow the regulations of the University of Manchester for behaviour towards others in respect of [equality, diversity and inclusion](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/connect/jobs/equality-diversity-inclusion/).

  (Technically, this is only a requirement of members of the University, but we expect others to follow the spirit of those rules while here, and they are part of rules we are required to enforce in respect of our work.)

* Behave professionally.

* Treat each other with respect.

* Review the contribution, not the contributor _(unless, by their **own** behaviour, the contributor **insists** otherwise)_.

We will attempt to:

* Resolve matters in a timely fashion.

* Keep contributors informed of decisions (or reasons for delaying a decision) in regards to their contribution. 

> [!NOTE]
> The first four points are the code that we follow, and the other points extend that to the code that we aspire to follow.  Arguably, those are points that are part of _behaving professionally_ and _treating with respect_ but it helps to have them as explicit goals.
