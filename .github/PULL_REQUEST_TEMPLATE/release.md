Release checklist:

- [ ] Make a `release` branch
- [ ] Make a PR for it <!-- using this template... -->
- [ ] Update version numbers, checking `README.md`s, `action.yml`s, and `bug.yml` in the issue templates
- [ ] Tag the release
- [ ] Rerun known tests after pointing them at the tag
- [ ] Fill in the release description data ("drafting" a release)
- [ ] Double-check you've done nothing silly!
- [ ] Make the GitHub release
- [ ] Merge the PR and delete the branch
