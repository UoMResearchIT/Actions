        Thank you for making a suggestion of some new action we should do.
        Usually, the more detail you can provide about what you think we should do, the easier it is to implement.

        If you know how, make a pull request as well; that will accelerate getting this feature in.

        What runner platforms do you want to support?
        Cross-platform actions are often more complex to develop and test, yet tend to be more useful.
        The Ubuntu runners tend to be fastest; they're recommended as default choices.
      options:
        - All
