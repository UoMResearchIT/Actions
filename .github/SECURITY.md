# Security of the Actions of UoMResearchIT

We take the securing of these actions _very_ seriously. If there's a problem, we want to know as soon as possible; we'd rather an issue be reported to us multiple times than not at all!

We aim to fix security problems as rapidly as possible. _In extremis,_ if faults in these actions are being used to attack systems (especially those of the University, but not only) then we will disable their use entirely. It is our strong desire to avoid that!

## Reporting Security Problems

You may either:
* [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/UoMResearchIT/actions/issues/new), or
* email the Team.

The latter is preferred for anything that needs confidentiality.

## UoM Reporting

Members of the University of Manchester may also use Connect to report problems with this repository.  
Members of Research IT may contact the Automation Working Group directly on Teams to report problems.
