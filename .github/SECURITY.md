# Security of the Actions of UoMResearchIT

We take the securing of these actions _very_ seriously. If there's a problem, we want to know as soon as possible; we'd rather an issue be reported to us multiple times than not at all!

We aim to fix security problems as rapidly as possible. _In extremis,_ if faults in these actions are being used to attack systems (especially those of the University, but not only) then we will disable their use entirely. It is our strong desire to avoid that!

## Reporting Security Problems

You may either:
* [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/UoMResearchIT/actions/issues/new), or
* [Report via Connect](https://www.itservices.manchester.ac.uk/help/connect/) (see that page for details of how to report issues to the Research IT Application Support channel without a University account).

The latter is preferred for any report that needs confidentiality.

## UoM Reporting

Non-confidential reports should be made via [issues](https://github.com/UoMResearchIT/actions/issues/new).

Members of the University of Manchester should use Connect to report problems with this repository if confidentiality is required; see our [Application Support](https://research-it.manchester.ac.uk/services/application-support/) page for details, including a direct link to the reporting form.

Members of Research IT may contact the Automation Working Group directly on Teams to report problems.
