# Download File

Downloads a file from a URL, using a cached version if possible.

Example:
```yml
  - uses: UoMResearchIT/actions/download@v0.3
    with:
      url: https://research-it.manchester.ac.uk/
      local-name: homepage.html
```

Example of accessing a protected resource:
```yml
  - uses: UoMResearchIT/actions/download@main
    with:
      url: https://api.github.com/repo/UoMResearchIT/actions=test/contents/README.md
      local-name: read-me.md
      content-type: application/vnd.github.raw+json
      token: ${{ secrets.MY_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```

> [!TIP]
> If using the `token` input, you almost certainly ought to be getting its value from the
> [GitHub `secrets` context](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).

> [!WARNING]
> This action can potentially exfiltrate the provided token. You should only provide a token if it is _necessary_ to access the URL, and the token was originally created with the intention that it be used to access that URL. Any pull request involving this action should be reviewed carefully if it provides a token.
